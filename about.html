<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    Welcome! This is an introduction to the author (since he is not famous, yet).<br/>
    I'm a Computer Engineering graduate student at University of Waterloo. My current focus area is Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and have done my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also working as a Data Scientist at UbiLab (Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab) on some really cool zero-effort health technology projects. It brings Big data, artificial intelligence, and health data analytics together for large-scale, population-level studies to evaluate adoption of zero effort technology.
    Before coming to graduate school I worked as a Data Engineer at ZS Associates where I helped big pharmaceutical clients to implement their Data Wareshousing and Business Intelligence solutions. Formerly, I worked as an Anaytics Engineer in their network domian (specifically CORE). I worked on creating in-house data analytical tools, IAM  and improving visibility into streaming network metrics. 
    <br/>

    Apart from my interest in Data world, I do enjoy learning about Networks, IoT and algorithms.

    Now, an introduction to what we are here for.<br/>
    A blog site dedicated to sharing insights and knowledge on various technical topics including Distributed Systems, Data Science, and Computer Networks. 
    The content ranges from personal notes from reading research papers to synthesized information gathered from multiple online sources, complemented with a touch of personal experience.
    The aim is to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of these complex concepts.
